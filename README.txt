This bank management system consists of 4 classes which were coded with inheritence in mind. The classes are a bank class, an account class, a checking account class, and a savings account class. While the account class is a child of the bank class, the checking account class and the savings account class are both children of the account class, making them sibling classes.
The bank class has two methods to register a checking account and a savings account by creating a new instance of each class with given parameters. The ID is a randomly 9-digit generated number and serves as our account number. The account class has a few methods, most significantly the withdraw, deposit, and check_bal methods. The checking account class does not contain any additional methods, as the functions of a checking account do not require any additional actions that weren't covered. However, the savings account class has a unique withdraw function that checks if the amount that is being withdrawn is greater than the withdraw limit, and checks if the amount of transfers allowed has exceeded. There is also a method to add interest to the balance.
